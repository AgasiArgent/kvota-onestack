# Session Plan - 2026-02-06 #2

## Context
- Previous session: session_2026-02-06_1 (10 tasks completed, 0 fix cycles, all reviews passed)
- Architecture: NEW hierarchical squad model (first test)
- ClickUp list: kvota
- Carry forward: 0 tasks from session 1

## Planned Tasks
| # | ClickUp ID | Task | Squad | Status | Time |
|---|-----------|------|-------|--------|------|
| M1 | 86af5wenr | Объединить Юрлица в /companies с 2 табами, убрать из /admin | squad-1 | Complete | 15min |
| M2 | 86af5wenz | Удалить standalone /buyer-companies, редирект /seller-companies | squad-1 | Complete | 10min |
| M3 | 86af5wepg | Аудит нерабочих страниц и чистка | squad-1 | Complete | 5min |

## Squad Allocation
| Squad | Tasks | Owned Files |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| squad-1 | M1, M2, M3 | main.py (menu + admin + company routes), all company-related routes |

## Session Progress
- [start] Squad-1 assigned all 3 tasks (M1, M2, M3). Squad-lead: squad-lead-1 (opus model).
- [start] All tasks touch main.py only. Squad has exclusive ownership of main.py company/admin routes.
- [in-progress] Squad-1 working on M1+M2+M3. Awaiting completion report.
- [completed] Squad-1 completed all 3 tasks. 1 fix cycle during code review.
  M1 (86af5wenr): Created /companies with 2 tabs (Продавцы/Покупатели), updated sidebar. 15min.
  M2 (86af5wenz): Removed standalone list pages, added redirects, kept CRUD routes. 10min.
  M3 (86af5wepg): Updated cross-references (document upload redirects). 5min.
  Files changed: main.py (-664/+253 lines, net -411 lines)
- [completed] All 3 tasks passed browser testing. Sent to backlog-manager for ClickUp completion.

## Session Summary
- Duration: ~30min squad time
- Tasks completed: 3/3
- Tasks carried forward: 0
- Total dev time logged to ClickUp: 30min (15+10+5)
- Fix cycles: 1 (code review)
- Code impact: main.py net -411 lines (cleanup/consolidation)

### Key Resolutions
- M1: Unified /companies page with Продавцы/Покупатели tabs, removed from /admin section
- M2: Eliminated standalone /buyer-companies and /seller-companies list pages, added redirects
- M3: Fixed cross-references (document upload redirects) to new /companies routes

### Squad Model Assessment (First Test)
- Squad-lead (opus) coordinated 3 related tasks within single squad
- All tasks touched same file (main.py) -- squad ownership model prevented conflicts
- Net code reduction (-411 lines) indicates successful consolidation
- 1 fix cycle (acceptable for refactoring work)

## Velocity
- Previous session: 10 tasks in ~3h (all passed review, 0 fix cycles)
- This session: 3 tasks in ~30min squad time, 1 fix cycle
- Running average: 13 tasks across 2 sessions
- Trend: Squad model efficient for related cleanup/refactoring tasks
