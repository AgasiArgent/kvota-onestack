TASK: [P2.4+P2.5] Unified payments tab on /finance + customer debt summary
URL: /finance

TEST 1: Unified payments tab
STEPS:
1. Navigate to /finance
2. Look for tabs — there should be a "Платежи" (Payments) tab (may have replaced "Календарь")
3. Click the "Платежи" tab
4. Verify the tab loads and shows a table of payment items (plan_fact_items)
5. Table should have columns like: deal/spec reference, category, planned amount, actual amount, status, dates
6. Check for filter controls:
   - Category filter (income/expense types)
   - Status filter (planned/partial/completed/overdue/cancelled)
   - Period/date filter
7. Try applying a filter — verify the table updates
8. Check for a summary row at the bottom (totals)
9. Check console for errors

TEST 2: Customer grouping toggle
STEPS:
1. On the same /finance Платежи tab
2. Look for a toggle/button to switch between "Плоский список" (flat) and "По клиентам" (by customer) views
3. Click the grouped view toggle
4. Verify payments are now grouped by customer name with subtotals
5. Click back to flat view — verify it returns to the regular table
6. Check console for errors

TEST 3: Customer debt summary card
STEPS:
1. Navigate to any customer detail page (e.g., from /companies or customer profile)
2. Look for a "Задолженность" (Debt) or payment summary card/section
3. Verify it shows:
   - Total outstanding amount (unpaid plan_fact_items)
   - Number of pending payments
   - Possibly overdue indicators
4. If the customer has no deals/payments, the card should show zero or "Нет данных"
5. Check console for errors

EXPECT:
- "Платежи" tab visible on /finance page
- Table shows plan_fact_items with proper columns
- Filters work (category, status, period)
- Flat/grouped toggle switches views correctly
- Customer grouping shows subtotals per customer
- Debt summary card on customer detail page shows outstanding amounts
- Summary footer with totals
- No console errors
- No regression on other /finance tabs (ERPS, etc.)
