TASK: [P2.2] IDN-SKU signing validation — block spec signing if quote items lack IDN-SKU
URL: /spec-control
STEPS:
1. Navigate to /spec-control
2. Find a specification in "Черновик" (draft) status — click to open detail page
3. Look at the spec detail page — note the current status
4. Try to change status to "Подписана" (signed) using the status dropdown or button
5. If the underlying quote items do NOT have IDN-SKU values, expect a validation error message
6. The error should mention that IDN-SKU is required on all positions before signing
7. If all items already have IDN-SKU, the signing should succeed normally
8. Check for any console errors

ADDITIONAL TEST (admin path):
1. Navigate to a spec that has items WITHOUT IDN-SKU
2. As admin, try to change status directly
3. Expect the same validation blocking — admin should NOT bypass IDN-SKU check
4. Verify the error message is clear and actionable

EXPECT:
- Specs with items missing IDN-SKU CANNOT be signed (validation error shown)
- Specs with all items having IDN-SKU CAN be signed normally
- Error message mentions which items are missing IDN-SKU or a count
- No console errors
- No regression on normal signing flow (specs that already have IDN-SKU)
