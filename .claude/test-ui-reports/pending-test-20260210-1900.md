TASK: [BUG-A2] Spec update persistence — contract, delivery_days, auto-number
URL: /spec-control/create/ba4a486f-d2cb-4356-8832-db9db3c54246
STEPS:
1. Navigate to spec creation page for quote Q-202602-0073 (UUID: ba4a486f-d2cb-4356-8832-db9db3c54246)
2. If redirected to existing spec (36801d1b-5785-476e-80dc-fc18610f64a2), use admin panel to reset status to "Черновик"
3. Select a contract from the "Договор" dropdown (e.g., "ДП-20260201 от 2026-02-01")
4. Note which contract was selected
5. Enter 44 in "Срок поставки (дней)" field
6. Click "Сохранить" button
7. After page reloads, check:
   - a) Contract dropdown still shows the selected contract (NOT "Без привязки к договору")
   - b) Specification number auto-generated (NOT "Без номера") — format like "CONTRACT_NUM-1"
   - c) Delivery days shows 44 (NOT empty)
EXPECT: All 3 fields persist after save. Contract shown, spec number auto-generated, delivery_days = 44.

TASK: [BUG-C2] Admin deal creation when setting status to "signed"
URL: /spec-control/36801d1b-5785-476e-80dc-fc18610f64a2
STEPS:
1. Navigate to spec detail page
2. Use admin panel to set status to "Черновик" first (reset)
3. Then use admin panel to set status to "Подписана"
4. After redirect, check if page shows:
   - "Спецификация подписана. Сделка создана." (green with check-circle icon)
   - OR "Спецификация подписана. Сделка не создана." (amber with alert-circle icon)
5. Navigate to /deals
6. Look for a new deal associated with this spec (deal number pattern: DEAL-2026-NNNN)
7. The new deal should appear in the deals list
EXPECT: Admin "signed" status creates deal. Green "Сделка создана" message shown. Deal visible in /deals list.

TASK: [RE-VERIFY] Group B — no duplicate in spec-control list
URL: /dashboard?tab=spec-control
STEPS:
1. Navigate to spec-control dashboard
2. Search for Q-202602-0073
3. Count how many times it appears
4. It should appear EXACTLY once in the correct status section
EXPECT: No duplicate entries. Quote appears only once.

TASK: [RE-VERIFY] ERPS View — spec_sum_usd shows correct amount
URL: /finance?tab=erps
STEPS:
1. Navigate to ERPS tab
2. Check "Сумма спец. USD" column for test specs
3. Values should be non-zero (e.g., $2,232.12 / $7,409.33)
4. Check footer "ИТОГО К ПОЛУЧЕНИЮ" — should show non-zero total
EXPECT: spec_sum_usd shows real USD amounts, not $0.00.

TASK: [RE-VERIFY] Deal visibility in /deals after spec signing
URL: /deals
STEPS:
1. Navigate to /deals page
2. Look for deals (should include both old DEAL-2026-0001 and any new deal from BUG-C2 test)
3. All deals should be visible in the list with proper FK resolution (customer name, spec number)
EXPECT: Deals list loads without errors. New deal from admin signing is visible.
